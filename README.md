You can see roomdash live by checking out http://roomdash.com.

To get it to actually run locally, you're going to have to get your own API keys to Twitter and Google+ and provide them in a non-sample version of the Roomdash\Engine\Secrets\ApiKeys.cs.SAMPLE file.

Some more info is available on my introductory [blog post](http://gusperez.com/wp/introducing-roomdash-my-latest-side-project/)
